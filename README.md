# SP2016-BatchEdit
Batch Edit Codeplex project upgraded from 2010 to 2016

This is a copy of the codeplex project https://sp2010batchedit.codeplex.com/ and the project has been upgraded to work with SharePoint 2016.

The project is still a farm based solution. 

The on going plan is to fix the pending bugs and update the functionality as needed. Advice and inputs are greatly appreciated.
